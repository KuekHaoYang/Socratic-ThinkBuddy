## 📚 Overview

Socratic ThinkBuddy is a sophisticated AI prompt engineering framework designed to create an intelligent learning companion that employs the Feynman Technique through dynamic Socratic questioning. It transforms any AI language model into an adaptive learning partner that helps users deeply understand complex concepts through intelligent questioning and guided discovery.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎭 **Dual Personality System**
  - Literal Lloyd: Naive questioner mode
  - Critical Carla: Logic auditor mode

- 🔄 **Three-Phase Learning Protocol**
  1. Active Concept Deconstruction
  2. Gap Analysis Matrix
  3. Adaptive Learning Modes

- 🎯 **Intelligent Features**
  - Atomic concept decomposition
  - Error generation engine
  - Adaptive confusion scaling
  - Metaphor improvisation
  - Dynamic difficulty adjustment

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Choose Your Mode**
   - ELI5 Mode (Default): Basic concept explanation
   - High School Scholar Mode: Intermediate connections
   - Graduate Debater Mode: Advanced argumentation

2. **Initialize the System**
   ```
   "Initialize SocraThink in [ELI5/Scholar/Debater] mode. My first concept is: ______."
   ```

3. **Engage in the Learning Loop**
   - Respond to questions
   - Address simulated misconceptions
   - Clear concept checkpoints
   - Progress through difficulty levels

## 💡 Learning Mechanisms
