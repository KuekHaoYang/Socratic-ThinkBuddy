# Contributing to Socratic ThinkBuddy

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Socratic ThinkBuddy as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Improving the core persona design
- Enhancing interaction protocols
- Adding new learning modes
- Reporting bugs or effectiveness
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Contributing Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added new features:
   - Test them with different LLM models
   - Document the effectiveness with examples
   - Ensure they follow the core interaction protocol
3. If you've modified existing features:
   - Document the improvements
   - Provide before/after comparisons
   - Explain how it enhances learning outcomes
4. Ensure your description is clear and complete.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issue tracker

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Include the LLM model used
  - Provide the exact prompts/inputs
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Guidelines for Feature Submissions

When submitting new features or modifications, please ensure they:

1. Align with the core persona design principles
2. Follow the established interaction protocols
3. Include clear documentation of:
   - Purpose and intended learning outcomes
   - Implementation details
   - Testing results with different LLMs
4. Maintain or enhance the existing:
   - Knowledge simulation protocol
   - Persistence heuristics
   - Progress tracking
   - Tone management
5. Have been tested with at least one major LLM

## Testing Guidelines

Before submitting your contribution:

1. Test with at least one major LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
2. Document:
   - Response quality and consistency
   - Learning effectiveness metrics
   - Any limitations or specific conditions
3. Compare results with:
   - Different difficulty modes
   - Various subject matters
   - Different user knowledge levels
